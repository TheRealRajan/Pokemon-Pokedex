# Pokemon-Pokedex

### Pokemon Pokedex app using PokeAPI, PokeDex API and JavaScript.<br><br>

The Pokemon cards are dynamically generated as data is fetched from PokeAPI and the images from PokeDex API.<br><br>
The card consists of various details about the individual Pokemon like its <kbd>Serial Number</kbd>, <kbd>Image</kbd>, <kbd>Name</kbd>, <kbd>Weight</kbd>, <kbd>Height</kbd> and its <kbd>Type</kbd>. <br><br>
The border of the card also indicates the type of the Pokemon as the color is set accordingly. You can also hover over the color blob on the top right corner of the card to see its type.<br><br>
Various gradient effects have been used throughout the application like the webpage's background, on the card and even on the scrollbar<br>
